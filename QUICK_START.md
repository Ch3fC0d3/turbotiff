# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What's Done

Your TurboTIFFLAS web app is ready with:
- ✅ 100MB file upload support
- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/Ch3fC0d3/TurboTIFFLAS
- ✅ Google Vision API integration (optional OCR)
- ✅ Ready to deploy to Railway

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Deploy to Railway (5 minutes)

**Option A: Via Website (Easiest)**
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click "Start a New Project"
3. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select `Ch3fC0d3/TurboTIFFLAS`
5. Done! Railway gives you a live URL

**Option B: Via CLI**
```bash
cd D:\Users\gabep\Desktop\TurboTIFFLAS
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### 2. Set Up Google Vision API (Optional - for OCR)

Follow the detailed guide: `GOOGLE_VISION_SETUP.md`

**Quick summary:**
1. Create Google Cloud project
2. Enable Vision API
3. Create service account
4. Download JSON key
5. Add to Railway as environment variable

**Railway Environment Variable:**
- Name: `GOOGLE_VISION_CREDENTIALS_JSON`
- Value: (paste entire JSON key content)

### 3. Test Your App

**Without OCR (works immediately):**
- Upload TIFF file (up to 100MB)
- Manually enter depth and curve values
- Download LAS file

**With OCR (after Google Vision setup):**
- Upload TIFF file
- App auto-detects scale numbers
- Auto-detects track boundaries
- Download LAS file
