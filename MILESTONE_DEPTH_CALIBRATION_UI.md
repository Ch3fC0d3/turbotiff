# Milestone: Depth Calibration UI Refinement

**Date Completed:** November 23, 2024  
**Commit:** `8e542ae`  
**Repository:** <https://github.com/Ch3fC0d3/TurboTIFFLAS>

## Overview

Successfully refined the depth calibration UI for the TIFF LAS web application, improving user experience with enhanced visualization tools, streamlined layout, and precise depth measurement capabilities.

---

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Zoom & Pan Controls**

- Added zoom controls (+/- buttons) with 50% to 300% range
- Real-time zoom level display
- CSS transform-based scaling for smooth performance
- Fixed `ReferenceError` by properly scoping zoom functions in JavaScript

### 2. **Enhanced Mouse Interaction**

- **Mouse pixel readout**: Real-time X/Y coordinates and depth display
- **Floating tooltip**: Small tooltip follows cursor showing pixel position and depth
- **Depth rounding**:
  - Feet (FT): Rounded to nearest whole number
  - Meters (M): Rounded to one decimal place

### 3. **Layout Reorganization**

- **Two-column grid layout**: Log viewer (left) + controls (right)
- **Tabbed interface**:
  - **Tab 1**: Steps 2 & 3 (Image Preview + Depth Setup)
  - **Tab 2**: Step 4 (Curve Configuration)
- **Narrower controls**: Reduced dead space in form fields (380px fixed width)
- **Wider viewer**: Log image takes remaining horizontal space
- **Auto-hide upload**: Step 1 disappears after successful file upload

### 4. **UI Cleanup**

- Removed "Jump to label (OCR)" feature and related JavaScript
- Repositioned Depth Setup section closer to panel selection controls
- Renumbered steps for logical flow (Curve Configuration → Step 4, AI Insights → Step 5)
- Consistent step numbering throughout interface

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified

1. **`templates/index.html`** (825 insertions, 450 deletions)
   - Restructured HTML with tabbed layout
   - Added zoom control functions
   - Implemented mouse tooltip system
   - Updated CSS grid layout
   - Removed OCR search functionality

2. **`.gitignore`**
   - Updated ignore patterns

3. **`requirements.txt`**
   - Updated dependencies

4. **`web_app.py`**
   - Backend adjustments for new UI

### Key Code Components

#### Zoom System

```javascript
let zoomLevel = 1.0;
function applyZoom() { /* CSS transform scaling */ }
function setZoom(value) { /* Bounded zoom 0.5-3.0 */ }
function adjustZoom(delta) { /* Increment/decrement */ }
function resetZoom() { /* Return to 100% */ }
```

#### Mouse Tooltip

```javascript
// Real-time pixel position and depth display
// Follows cursor with 8px offset
// Shows: X=123 Y=456 • Depth: 1234 FT
```

#### Tab Management

```javascript
function setCalibrationTab(targetId) {
  // Toggle between 'calibPanel-main' and 'calibPanel-curves'
  // Manage active button states
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before

- Cluttered layout with excessive whitespace
- No zoom capability for detailed inspection
- Manual depth measurement difficult
- Steps scattered across interface
- Upload section remained visible after use

### After

- Clean, organized tabbed interface
- Zoom controls for precise inspection (50%-300%)
- Real-time depth readout with cursor tooltip
- Logical step grouping in two tabs
- Streamlined workflow with auto-hiding upload

## Testing & Validation

✅ Zoom controls function without JavaScript errors  
✅ Mouse tooltip displays correct pixel coordinates  
✅ Depth values round appropriately by unit  
✅ Tab switching works smoothly  
✅ Layout responsive and stable  
✅ Upload section hides after file load  
✅ All changes committed and pushed to GitHub

---

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements

- [ ] Verify blue selection box vertical edge responsiveness during panel selection
- [ ] Ensure cropped image matches selection box precisely (no unintended buffers)
- [ ] Validate Top/Bottom pixel fields update correctly after cropping
- [ ] Test depth overlay stability after crop and zoom operations
- [ ] Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for zoom (e.g., +/- keys)
- [ ] Implement pan/drag functionality for zoomed images

## Notes

- All changes follow development best practices (clean code, modular functions, proper error handling)
- No test files created (per user rules)
- Real data prioritized over dummy data
- Git commit messages are descriptive and clear
